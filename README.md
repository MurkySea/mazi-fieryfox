# MaZi FieryFox RPG

MaZi FieryFox is a lightweight browser RPG prototype. It features a simple task list, companions that can be unlocked via a gacha system, and a basic XP and coin economy.

## Getting Started

Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. You can double-click the file or serve the folder locally with a simple HTTP server:

```bash
npx http-server
```

Then navigate to the provided local URL.

## Saving Progress

The game uses the browser's local storage to persist data. Custom tasks, completed tasks, earned XP, coins and unlocked companions are all stored locally so your progress remains even after refreshing or closing the tab.
